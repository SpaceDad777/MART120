         This is my portfolio of evey assignment in this semester of creative coding. There is no project 13 due to Thanksgiving break. For this week I made a response on what the difference between a CLI and GUI.

         What is the difference between CLI and GUI

         CLI and GUI are some of the few fundamentals in coding. These interfaces help layout the commands to allow users to interact. The device's operating system enables the interaction between the user and the device. Although CLI and GUI have distinct functions. 
         CLI is used more on interfacing on the device. It is a text-based user interface that can run programs, interact, and manage computer files. This is in the form of lines of text. An example would be Windows command prompt or Linux bash shell. Once the user runs a command and the terminal will interpret the command and run that desired task and will eventually display a response from the system. 
         On the other hand, GUI is based on graphic and visual elements, allowing users to interact with the system by using a keyboard and a mouse. Its main priority is to facilitate system management and improving it to the user by menus, icons, and buttons, etc. An example of this is operating systems such as Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. 
         Overall, GUI and CLI can have their advantages and disadvantages. Some OS can provide users with only CLI, and others will offer both GUI and CLI. But both have advantages due to CLI requiring a keyboard for interaction while GUI requires a mouse.
